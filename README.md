# This Project was created during my education in Cooding Bootcamp.
# It's an Front-End Project, a site for a Private School. It's not connected with a database or a back-end.
# It's built with Bootstrap for the appearance and Javascript for the validations.
# Visit the https://elizakats.github.io/PrivateSchoolSite/index.html to see it.
